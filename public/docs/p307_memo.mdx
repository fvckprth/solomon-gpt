# Brief
## **The Challenge of Collaborative Commerce**

We began nearly two years ago as [*Qortor*](http://qortor.com), a marketplace for brands and influencers to create shoppable-video content. **After investing nearly ~$100K and 6 months of countless late nights, we identified a significant hurdle that was out of our control: the inability to execute multi-merchant checkout across third-party platforms. It was not just our challenge, but an issue affecting developers, entrepreneurs, and creators across the industry.

This problem is bigger than just us; any innovative developer or entrepreneur wanting to build a new e-commerce app or experience needs a lot of time and expensive custom integrations with various retailer websites and partners in order to launch. 

Additionally, the exchange of insights is usually one-sided. Consider a creator collaborating with a brand. The brand (supplier) is providing the product, while the creator (partner) is generating sponsored content about that product, but neither fully understood the other's context. The brand may not have a clear understanding of the creator's audience and their preferences. Conversely, the creator might not have access to crucial insights about the product's performance in the market or the brand’s demographic data. This lack of bi-directional information exchange impacts not only collaborations, but often times the relationship itself. 

![](https://paper-attachments.dropboxusercontent.com/s_487EF59A8D4C35221D1A65F77C772ED6699E87755F456C1EA145C445AA061D38_1689275794308_image.png)


Emerging AI technologies, like *ChatGPT*, can play a pivotal role in the exchange of those insights. By weaving AI into collaborative commerce, we're enabling all players — brands, developers, creators — to have the insights they need at their fingertips. This leads to stronger alliances and an improvement on how we work together within commerce.

However, there is nothing in the market that is streamlining this. That's where P307 emerges.


> P307’s vision is to make collaborative commerce easier for everyone by providing the building blocks for developers, founders, and creators to build any commerce they dream of together.

We aim to make collaborative commerce accessible and efficient for everyone by providing the essential building blocks for diverse stakeholders to construct collaborative commerce experiences of their dreams. We’ll allow any entity or platform to seamlessly access products and services on the internet, in real-time. 

P307 is designed to facilitate seamless multi-merchant transactions across different platforms, so that consumers can transact where they discover. We’re building the infrastructure for collaborative commerce, just like *Salesforce* did for CRM, and *Plaid* did for banking.

## Enabling Commerce 3.0

In the 20th-century retail scene, you think of Nordstrom, Macy’s, and Kohl’s. Need a new sweater? Visit Macy’s. A TV? Best Buy. Gardening supplies? Home Depot. Retailers aggregated brands for consumer convenience. Shopping malls then aggregated retailers, creating commerce hubs. 

Who are the aggregators for the 21st-century?

![](https://paper-attachments.dropboxusercontent.com/s_487EF59A8D4C35221D1A65F77C772ED6699E87755F456C1EA145C445AA061D38_1689190823238_image.png)


**The 21st-century product aggregators will be us** ⎯ creators, restaurants, publishers who've built communities and earned their followers' trust. Not all folks excel at founding brands. Some are tastemakers, trusted by large communities, yet unable to monetize this trust. 

This trust-based model of commerce signals a transition from Commerce 2.0 to Commerce 3.0. While Commerce 2.0 relied on large, centralized e-commerce stores, focusing on maximizing profits via a single, global store with centrally controlled pricing and product listing, the shift to Commerce 3.0 (Decentralized Commerce) emphasizes a more communal approach.

In Commerce 3.0, the traditional role of individual stores is reimagined into a network of creators, tastemakers, buyers, and sellers, all interconnected and contributing towards maximizing both local profit and the global economy. 

These moments of discovery and inspiration should empower customers to make informed purchases instantaneously from these tastemakers. With this in mind, we're entering Commerce 3.0, where commerce blends into contextual experiences for shoppers, including social commerce, conversational commerce, voice shopping, or live shopping. But this requires the right infrastructure for suppliers and partners to coexist ⎯ the current online experiences are slow, complicated, and expensive, hindering relationships and increasing time-to-market.

![](https://paper-attachments.dropboxusercontent.com/s_487EF59A8D4C35221D1A65F77C772ED6699E87755F456C1EA145C445AA061D38_1689276191424_image.png)


Traditional commerce tools have been predominantly tailored to resolve issues for merchants, focusing on aspects such as reaching new audiences, improving third-party logistics, or finding influencers. Often times, these tools are siloed and solve only parts of the overall problem, how does an influencer marketing platform like *Grin* interact with *Salesforce CommerceCloud*? 

We aim to transform partners into curated retailers and suppliers into beloved brands. Fostering a space where transparency between the partner and supplier is blunt and consumer relationships are valued. By aggregating global transactions and properly categorizing products, partners, and suppliers across numerous platforms, we're simplifying contextual product placement.

**P307 is the nexus for collaborative commerce** ⎯ the act of discovering, negotiating, and selling on a unified infrastructure. We believe that the future of commerce isn't about constructing a new reality, but about designing experiences that seamlessly integrate into the existing realities of consumers. 


## What does this mean for the future of other industries?


> **Disrupting the affiliate model.** Affiliate marketing is the top acquisition channel for 40% of US merchants. However, the traditional affiliate tracking model is outdated and inefficient.

New privacy laws limit tracking and the last-click attribution model makes it hard to gain a clear view of the entire user journey, and where sales come from. To truly transform commerce for shoppers, shopping needs to become product-first ⎯ when and wherever that may be.

![](https://paper-attachments.dropboxusercontent.com/s_487EF59A8D4C35221D1A65F77C772ED6699E87755F456C1EA145C445AA061D38_1689191033385_image.png)


 P307 aims to evolve this by facilitating multi-merchant checkouts ⎯ a single checkout for multiple products across various merchants. With our customizable yet unified solutions: native checkout API, simplified user interface, and partner links, we can track clicks without third-party cookies, improving the shopping experience and increasing order value.
 
For us, that means solving multi-merchant checkouts. The ability for shoppers to build a cart of products they love and checkout once for the entire order, without needing to visit each merchants' website separately. 

With a multi-merchant native checkout API, no-code friendly embeddable UI elements, and partner links we can disrupt the traditional affiliate model, allowing suppliers and partners to track clicks within their own environment using first-party tracking. The experience will no longer be disjointed with multiple CVV inputs. This democratization promises suppliers, creators, brands and publishers with an increased order value and conversion rates.


> **Wholesale without holding stock.** The traditional wholesale model is archaic, often forcing suppliers and brands to sell speculative stock quantities at reduced margins. This centralized yet siloed distribution system leads to inefficiencies, waste, and diminished profitability

P307 allows partners to place their products anywhere in the digital world. Brands have the freedom to distribute their products via anyone, anywhere, whilst retaining control over their inventory. This widened net of product placement provides suppliers with unprecedented reach and accessibility.

![](https://paper-attachments.dropboxusercontent.com/s_487EF59A8D4C35221D1A65F77C772ED6699E87755F456C1EA145C445AA061D38_1689280463861_image.png)


The beauty of this model is that suppliers and partners only ship products when they're purchased, meaning there's no risk of overstocking or under-stocking. Everyone is respectively responsible for their inventory. This not only reduces waste but also ensures suppliers can operate at higher profit margins.  

For instance, a partner specializing in eco-friendly products can leverage P307's platform to curate a range of sustainable goods from different brands worldwide. They can manage stock logistics, negotiate terms directly with the brands, and even enable other partners to sell these products, creating their own microcosm of sustainable commerce.

In essence, P307 is transforming the wholesale model into a unified infrastructure, where brands, partners, and consumers alike stand to gain.


> **Universal product perspective.** Think about your last online shopping journey for a new pair of shoes. A flurry of questions and countless reviews with hours invested continuously seeking third-party human context to justify a purchase. 

We're not about collecting personal data, but about contextualizing third-party product data. With the launch of *Google* *Perspective* this year  ⎯ showing search results from actual humans, this is now possible. When you shop with P307 from our trusted partners, you're met with a world of user-generated content from TikTok, Instagram, Reddit, and more. A click on a product reveals a tapestry of experiences ⎯ a TikTok unboxing, a Reddit comfort debate, Instagram photos of its daily use. Your purchase decision is informed, confident, and grounded in real-world context.

![](https://paper-attachments.dropboxusercontent.com/s_487EF59A8D4C35221D1A65F77C772ED6699E87755F456C1EA145C445AA061D38_1689274801203_image.png)


P307 is universal, embedding seamlessly into any platform. Be it a news outlet or an influencer’s shop, our enriched shopping journey enhances their customer experience. P307 simplifies shopping, making it a more satisfying and trust-less, deeply interconnected process.

In an age of hyper-personalization, we believe in the power of community-driven insights. Not invading privacy, but harnessing the wealth of product data both curated and public to offer a personalized shopping journey.

## What Comes Next

The future of commerce shouldn't be about fragmentation and confusion; it should be collaborative, accessible, and enjoyable for everyone involved. We invite you to join us as we reshape this future, transforming the landscape of collaborative commerce.

# Problem
## The faults in Our 'Partnerships'

**Collaborations are important to global trade.** But a lack of standardization and interoperability between tools (such as affiliate links, emails, and standalone platforms) creates a disjointed and inefficient ecosystem. 


- How does a *TikTok* creator leverage the sales from their affiliate links beyond simply receiving a monthly check? Is there a way to enhance their earnings and trace the impact they are making on the beauty brand they're promoting?
- A vodka brand spends $50,000 to license video content from a *YouTube* creator, but how do they track the direct impact of this expenditure on their sales? Is there a better way to ensure they are getting value for their investment?
- A lumber supplier in Russia sets up a revenue share agreement with local NY-based hardware retailers using a basic *Google Doc*. But how do they manage the complexities of consignment and stock monitoring? Can this rudimentary system handle the nuances of international trade, compliance, and logistics?
- A customer feels the need to turn to *Reddit* to verify the authenticity of affiliations between the brand and influencer. Could there be a way to streamline and display this relationship and build trust directly at checkout?

It’s the wild-west. These unanswered questions highlight significant gaps in how we currently approach collaborative commerce.

## Two Core Pain Points


1. **Attribution Challenges:** Outdated systems like affiliate links limit understanding of conversion factors, including influential content or contributors, thus constraining growth and revenue potential.


    - Shopping from multiple affiliate links is frustrating.
    - New privacy laws limit tracking capabilities.
    - There’s still no way to know what content converts.


2. **Partnerships Are a Black Box:** The industry lacks standardization and relies on inadequate methods for displaying affiliations, including "*#-ad*" tags and "*sponsored*" disclaimers. 


    - The FTC is increasingly enforcing partnership disclosure.
    - Vague affiliations create public distrust and partnership challenges.
    - No standardization of partnership agreements.
    
![](https://paper-attachments.dropboxusercontent.com/s_487EF59A8D4C35221D1A65F77C772ED6699E87755F456C1EA145C445AA061D38_1689376726733_image.png)


These are the immediate roadblocks that hinder the progress of collaborative commerce, holding us back from achieving a truly efficient, transparent, and profitable ecosystem.

## When Solutions Intensify Pain Points

The three-stage journey of collaborative commerce ⎯ discovery, negotiation, and execution ⎯ is severed and bandaid by current solutions. Most of these fall into three categories:

****
- **Too Many Affiliate Links:** Existing since the late 1990s, old guards like *CJ Affiliate* enable product promotion via affiliate links but even after 30 years they lack basic functionalities like native checkout or multi-merchant checkout. Link rot, or broken links, alone costs the industry over $160 million annually.
- **E-commerce Integrators Are Expensive:** While platforms like *Shopify* provide the basics for online stores and affiliate marketing, they don’t offer comprehensive solutions for managing partner content or facilitating direct sales by partners. High development costs of $50,000 or more also hinder the creation of custom solutions. 
- **Narrow Tools Distort Real ROI:** Influencer management tools like *Grin* help track campaign success but they fail to integrate with e-commerce platforms for order management, resulting in inaccurate ROI measurements. They also have a narrow definition of 'partners' and lack transparency in displaying influencer-brand relationships.

We personally experienced these problems with our previous venture. We have to rethink from the ground up on how we approach collaborative commerce. 

# Solution
## A Novel Approach

We are building a unified solution that not only addresses the pain points directly, but reimagines how we collaborate. We believe that by improving efficiency, introducing standardization, and providing transparency, we can transform how suppliers and distributors can prosper together. 


1. **Future-Proof Attribution:** Our suppliers will know the attribution of a partner sale from anywhere; a beauty video-first marketplace created by an influencer to the men's fashion article written by the New York Times.
2. **Default Transparency**: With the help of generative AI we can summarize the depth of supplier-partner relationships directly to the customer. We aim to eliminate the 'black box' issue prevalent in current practices.

| **Integrated Partnerships:**       | Suppliers benefit from partners who enhance the product's value by attaching related content and sharing their own experiences. These valuable insights are aggregated to provide a more comprehensive understanding of each product, enhancing its appeal to potential customers.          |
| **Dynamic Sales Tracking**         | With P307, suppliers are always in the know. Our platform shows who's selling their products, where they're being sold, and what kind of content is associated with each sale. This visibility empowers suppliers with the information they need to make informed decisions and strategies. |
| **Enhanced Market Reach**          | P307 extends suppliers' reach far beyond traditional boundaries. By enabling partners to share their products with their diverse audience, suppliers can tap into new markets and customer segments they might not have been able to reach otherwise.                                       |

## Overcome Limitations

We designed P307 with a clear vision: to fill the gaps where traditional solutions have stumbled. With a focus on unity, precision, and openness, P307 addresses the needs of everyone involved in the collaborative commerce process.


- **A** **Unified Solution**: Today’s industry practices are fragmented, with affiliate platforms, e-commerce integrators, and influencer management tools operating in silos. P307 resolves this by integrating all these functions into a single, go-to platform for collaborative commerce.
- **See the Full Picture:** Current solutions struggle to provide an accurate picture of conversion factors. That's frustrating for all — suppliers, partners, and customers. P307 changes this. With our platform, you get a clear view of the impact of your actions. No more guesswork.
- **Openness and Uniformity:** The complexity and lack of transparency and standardization in existing practices often create confusion. P307 is built on principles of transparency and standardization, making transactions simpler, clearer, and more trustworthy.
## Why P307
[ ] **(product tablet + mobile)**

P307 will be the new standard in collaborative commerce, offering superior connectivity, smart attribution, and a high-quality design and UX. Our platform streamlines operations, provides actionable insights, and creates an intuitive and engaging user experience.

Think of P307, as *Alibaba meets Stripe for collaborative commerce*.

# Product Principles
## Supplier Flow

Suppliers provide the product or service. They can be manufacturers, distributors, wholesalers, service providers, or any other entity that has products or services that could be promoted or sold by partners.


1. **Import Products**
2. **Assign Share**
3. **Invite Partners**


[ ] **(product mock — 3 products,. mobile view)**

**Import Products**
The supplier is invited either through the team at P307 or through an existing partner. The sign up process will be critical as our first AI-related feature will involve our trained model to analyze the supplier and categorize them properly for the future. 

After sign up, the suppliers are shown how they would like to add their products. There are three ways to add their products:


- **Connect:** Seamlessly integrate and sync with existing e-commerce platform
- **Import:** Upload a CSV file for bulk product addition
- **Add:** Manually input product information for small catalogs
![](https://paper-attachments.dropboxusercontent.com/s_487EF59A8D4C35221D1A65F77C772ED6699E87755F456C1EA145C445AA061D38_1689533547998_image.png)


The second feature involves text classification, a new approach on the way e-commerce products are categorized and tagged. We'll derive meaningful insights about suppliers' demographic, audience preferences, and available context facilitating a three-dimensional approach to product taxonomy. This incorporates attributes not only based on product features but factors related to human-interest. 

For instance, a clothing brand in Lower East Side, NYC, known for its connection to the hip-nightlife and trendy speakeasy bars, would have its products intelligently categorized and tagged. Tags such as 'Urban Fashion', 'Quality', 'Nightlife', and 'Speakeasy' don't solely refer to the product but the lifestyle, story, and cultural context associated with it. This will relates a comprehensive, vivid picture of the product and its persona, enhancing product discoverability and improving the customer shopping experience.

![](https://paper-attachments.dropboxusercontent.com/s_487EF59A8D4C35221D1A65F77C772ED6699E87755F456C1EA145C445AA061D38_1689537587842_image.png)


In contrast, traditional approaches to product taxonomy tend to rely on manual effort and are based on narrow product attributes, rudimentary categorizations, and prone to human-error that impact discoverability and conversion.

**Assign Share**
Once the products are added, the supplier will assign its share for the partners in the ecosystem. There are three types of shares that can be applied for their products:

| **Type**            | **Description**                                                                   | **Example**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

In summary, the flexibility of share assignments can cater to the unique needs of different suppliers and partners, promoting a symbiotic relationship that benefits all parties involved.

**Invite Partners**
Suppliers have the ability to invite partners directly to the P307 platform. The process begins by providing the potential partner's contact information, after which an invitation with detailed information about the supplier, their products, and the terms of share are sent.

Upon receiving the invitation, the partner can learn about the supplier's products, the proposed shares, and any additional conditions or bonuses that might be in place. The invitation process is designed to be transparent and informative, giving partners a clear picture of what to expect before joining the platform.


> **Cold Invitation:** For potential partners with whom suppliers do not have an existing relationship, they can use a cold invitation method. This involves sending an invite to the contact information available, introducing them to P307 platform and the benefits it offers. 
> 
> **Self-Signup:** Suppliers can share a link or a QR-code that allows potential partners to sign up to the P307 platform directly. This link could be displayed on various channels like the supplier's website, social media, brick-and-mortar shops, email newsletters, etc. 
> 
> **Term Sheet:** This method is more direct and specific, as it involves sending a detailed proposal or term sheet to potential partners outlining details, benefits, share percentage they would receive.

Traditional suppliers have an important role to play in this new world. They are, after all, the ones bringing new products and services into existence. But that doesn’t mean they need to be devoting as much time and resources as they do now on distribution and finding new customers.

## Partner Flow

Partners promote or sell the product or service by the supplier. These could be influencers, publishers, retailers, or any other entity that has an audience or customer base that could benefit from the products or services provided by suppliers.


1. **Select Products**
2. **Add Artifacts**
3. **Generate Routes**

**Select Products**
The partner is invited either through the team at P307 or through an existing partner or supplier. Similar to suppliers, the sign up process will be critical as our first AI-related feature will involve our trained model to analyze the partner and categorize them properly for the future.

Products listed on the platform will have a base partner share displayed. This share what the partner earns without the need for approval. However, they’ll be many ways for partners to enhance the terms of the agreement, few of them include the following:


- **Take charge of fulfillment:** Handle the delivery of the products themselves.
- **Contribute artifacts:** Enrich the product's story by providing additional artifacts.
- **Establish tiered earnings:** Set up a system where the partner's share increases based on the number of products sold, incentivizing more active promotion.

Moreover, the platform is designed to foster reciprocal relationships between suppliers and partners. For instance, a tea shop in China may want to create an NYC route and invite a local tea dealer in the city to collaborate. 


[ ] **(product components on the process of selecting products for the NYC route, with 5-6 tea related products from different suppliers)**

The flexibility in product selection, the room for negotiation on terms, and the ability to invite others to collaborate, create an environment that supports innovation, inclusivity, and a shared vision for success.

**Add Artifacts**
After the partners have selected their products, the next step involves adding artifacts. Artifacts are essentially elements that enhance the product card to make it more engaging, relevant, and effective. This could involve adding unique descriptions, long-form narratives, lifestyle images, short videos, testimonials, audio, and other supporting media. 

Artifacts can be the following:


- **Images:** These can be in several formats, including JPEG (.jpg or .jpeg), PNG (.png), GIF (.gif), and more. Images are often used to showcase products or create appealing visual content that grabs the viewer's attention.
- **Video:** Videos can offer a dynamic and engaging way to present a product or concept. These files can come in formats like MP4 (.mp4), MOV (.mov), AVI (.avi), or others.
- **Audio:** Audio files can be useful for things like podcasts or sound clips. They might be in MP3 (.mp3), WAV (.wav), or other formats.
- **Documents:** These can include text files (.txt), PDFs (.pdf), Word documents (.doc or .docx), Excel spreadsheets (.xls or .xlsx), PowerPoints (.ppt or .pptx), and more. These types of files can provide more detailed information or data about a product or concept.
- **HTML files:** These can be used to add interactive elements, like quizzes or embedded apps, to a page.


[ ] **(show example of different P307 artifacts for a specific product)**

Artifacts are also classified in two categories: 


1. **Curated Artifacts:** These are thoughtfully selected or created by partners or suppliers to build an engaging narrative around the products. They are unique and specific to the partner's offering, emphasizing the authenticity of the product. Here are five examples:
| **Type of Curated Artifact** | **Description**                                                                                          | **Example**                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| 3. **Instructional Manuals** | Detailed guides on how to use the product, generally provided in PDF or DOC formats.                     | A coffee machine manufacturer might provide a comprehensive, step-by-step guide on setting up the machine, brewing the perfect cup of coffee, and cleaning the machine afterwards.                                        |
| 4. **Customer Testimonials** | Audio or video clips of customers sharing their positive experiences with the product.                   | A language learning app might share video testimonials from users who successfully learned a new language, sharing their journey and the effectiveness of the app.                                                        |
| 5. **Interactive Content**   | HTML files or embeddable web elements that provide interactive experiences related to the product.       | A skincare brand might create a personalized skin assessment tool where users answer a series of questions about their skin type and concerns, and receive personalized product recommendations based on their responses. |

2. **Public Artifacts:** Leveraging *Google Perspectives*, these artifacts are culled real-time from public forums, Q&A sites, and social media platforms to provide a broad range of viewpoints and experiences related to the product. Here are five examples:

| **Type of Public Artifact**     | **Description**                                                                                                                                    | **Example**                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. **User-Generated Content**   | Images, videos, or text content created by users, which often includes reviews, unboxing videos, or pictures of the product in real-life settings. | A user posts a photo on Instagram of them wearing a dress from a specific brand, showing how it looks in a real-world setting.                  |
| 2. **Social Media Posts**       | Posts made by influencers, celebrities, or other users that include the product. These can be on platforms like *Instagram* or *TikTok*.           | An influencer on *TikTok* shares a video of them using a new fitness product and demonstrating its benefits.                                    |

This extra layer of rich and personalized content significantly improves the product's appeal and contextual fit with the partner's audience. It makes the promoted product feel more like a natural part of the content rather than an obvious sales pitch. In the beginning, P307 will only support curated artifacts.

**Generate Routes**
Routes are the channels or methods through which partners can promote the supplier's products. They are essentially the 'roads' that connect the products with the partners' audiences or customers to enable multi-checkout functionality anywhere. P307 will provide three types of routes:


- **Partner Link:**  This is the easiest route — an external link that partners can share via various platforms, such as social media, email, or even text messages. When clicked, the link will display the route, which will consist of a product page or a curated collection of products. 
- **Elements:** Quickly build seamless, integrated commerce experiences within their existing digital properties using prebuilt UI components. Within a simple script to enable an uninterrupted shopping journey, right from product discovery to checkout. The types of Elements include:
    
    - **Product Elements:** Display product details.
    - **Artifact Elements:** Display aggregated artifacts associated with the product.
    - **Checkout Elements:** Let shoppers purchase the products in their cart.
        
- **API:** When the customization of the Elements is not enough, use the API to build something completely tailored to your use case. Examples include the following:
| **API Use Case**               | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Travel Video Platform**      | A travel vlogger could use the API to develop a short-form video platform where each video is paired with relevant products (like travel gear, guide books, or local delicacies). Viewers can directly purchase these items while watching the vlogger's adventures.                                                                                           |
| **Personalized Shopping App**  | A fashion influencer might use the API to create a personalized shopping app, where their followers can shop their recommended outfits, receive personalized style recommendations, and even virtually try on clothes before making a purchase.                                                                                                                |
| **Japandi Furniture Designer** | Utilizing the API, a Japandi-inspired furniture designer could transform the standard review system by creating an interactive feature. This feature could allow customers to submit their personal experiences, photos, and stories about their purchased pieces, providing a richer, more authentic connection between their brand, products, and customers. |

Every transaction, click, interaction, impression through these routes can be tracked, analyzed, and attributed correctly. This wealth of information opens the door to data-driven decisions like never before, not only enhancing our understanding of specific audience's behavior, preferences, and engagement but also democratizing these insights for everyone involved.


[ ] **(show illustration of 3 different ways to include the routes)**


## Customer Flow

The customers are the end consumers of the product or service; they are typically the audience or followers of the partners on the platform. The customer flow involves the processes that customers follow from product discovery to making a purchase.


1. **Product Discovery**
2. **Build Cart**
3. **Multi-Merchant Checkout**

**Product Discovery**
The first step in the customer journey is product discovery. This process is made engaging through the partner’s route. When a customer clicks on the partner link or engages with the embedded elements, they are displayed a simple product page that provides them with comprehensive and visually compelling information about the product.


[ ] **(webpages of New York Times Succession article, with elements of products)**

**Build Cart**
As customers navigate through the products, they have the option to add their desired products to their cart. Regardless of which website, application, social media platform, blog, or digital space they are visiting, their cart will always be accessible. This is facilitated by their global P307 account which creates a unified shopping cart that exists across the web, wherever there is a partner.


[ ] **(show how their P307 cart is shown everywhere, with whomever has a P307 account)**

A unique feature at this stage is the transparency and narrative building by the use of AI summarization. This is where the relationship between the supplier and the partner is explicitly described to the customer through a simple info icon, providing context, authenticity, and added trust. Here are five examples:

| **Supplier-Partner Relationship**         | **Narrative Description**                                                                                                                                                                            | **Checkout Narrative Example**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

By adding narratives to the checkout process, P307 brings an additional layer of transparency and authenticity, emphasizing the human element often overlooked in digital commerce. These narratives, ranging from simple to elaborate, give a personal touch to customers' purchases.


[ ] **(product component — P307 narratives, what would be displayed at checkout)**

With a P307 account, customers experience a seamless shopping process, allowing them to add products from different partners across various platforms to a single cart. This reduces cart abandonment for partners and suppliers. Whether it's a book recommended on an influencer's blog or a bottle of wine from a local restaurant's website, all items coexist in the same P307 cart.

**Multi-Merchant Checkout**
Our customers can explore and add items from multiple suppliers to a single cart, eliminating the need for separate transactions on different websites. It's about convenience, speed, and simplicity, keeping shopping enjoyable and straightforward. To truly transform commerce for shoppers, shopping needs to become product-first — when and wherever that may be.

We then take the unified order and break it down, managing placements with each supplier seamlessly. The result is a unified, joyful shopping journey leading to increased basket sizes and conversion rates for our partners.

With this seamless shopping experience, our partners enjoy tangible benefits. The streamlined process encourages larger basket sizes and improved conversion rates, leading to increased sales. Furthermore, the ease of use and convenience offered by P307's multi-merchant checkout fosters customer loyalty, creating lasting relationships for our partners.

# Go-to-Market
## Business Model

We aim to adopt a freemium to premium subscription model, meaning our partners and suppliers can start their journey with us for free and scale as their business grows. We have three pricing models:

| **Model**         | **Description**                                                                                                         | **Example**                                                                                                        |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Susbcription**  | We’ll offer a freemium model to the supplier, **$2****9****/month** for premium features.                               | supplier chooses to upgrade from the free account to access enhanced features and gets billed **$20 each month**.  |
| **Take-Rate**     | We charge a **5% fee** whenever the supplier or partner will pay out to their bank account.                             | If a supplier makes a sale resulting in a $200 payout, we would charge a **$10 fee** *(5% of $200)*.               |
| **Visibile Fees** | We charge suppliers **25**¢/**order** **fulfilled** for displaying their relationship with the partner to the customer. | If a supplier makes 100 sales in a day, they would be **charged** **$25** *(100 sales * $0.25)* for Visibile Fees. |

## Early Adopters

We’ll be sector agnostic — our previous venture *Qortor*, was focused in the beauty sector, however we realized that instead of specifically beauty brands we should’ve had more focus on well-crafted products that already have community champions promoting them. 

As for our suppliers, they will include the following:

**Local and Artisan Producers:** This category includes local brands, artisans, and producers who create unique, often handmade items. 


> A local bakery that produces organic bread.

**Emerging Brands:** Emerging brands may be startups or newer businesses looking for opportunities to increase their brand awareness and expand their customer base. 


> A startup producing innovative plant-based protein foods.
> A new online fashion brand focusing on trendy accessories.
> A new tech brand that creates smart home devices.

# Market Analysis
## Why is Now the Right Time?

Two major shifts in e-commerce display the urgency of the issue:


- **The Importance of UGC:** Consumer trust is shifting from traditional advertising to trusted recommendations. Influencer marketing has grown nearly tenfold, from $1.7B to $13.8B in the last five years. However, nearly 70% of consumers are becoming uncomfortable with the lack of transparency in sponsored posts.
- **The Advent of AI:** Generative AI models have revolutionized personalized content creation. AI can help classify partners, brands, and products more effectively, making it easier for consumers to find exactly what they want.

The global e-commerce market is set to hit $4.9 trillion by 2025, and collaborative commerce is poised to seize a large chunk of this growth. The moment to act is now.


## The Importance of UGC

User-generated content (UGC) is driving this change, creating more memorable brands. These personal narratives, lifestyle-centric suggestions, and credible voices are what truly engage audiences and catalyze conversions. 

Platforms like *Douyin*, *Pinduoduo*, and *Kuaishou* in the East, and *Instagram* and *TikTok* in the West, are leveraging this shift. *Douyin's* user base, predominantly Gen Z and Millennials, has shown a distinct preference for UGC, with 73% active on the platform. As of now, in 2023, people are watching, on average, 10 hours of *TikTok* videos per week. That’s more than half to the ~17 hours of TV people watch a week.

The commercial potential of UGC is significant. *Kuaishou* experienced a 3.2x growth in gross merchandise volume (GMV) in 2021, while *Diouyin's* inaugural *618* *Good Product Festival* recorded a 97% YoY increase in livestream hours.

However, the surge in UGC also brings challenges. The vast amount of content can overwhelm consumers, giving rise to 'Curation as a Service' (CaaS), where creators, publishers, and businesses curate quality products and services. 

Transparency remains a challenge, with blurred lines between organic content and sponsored posts leading to trust erosion and deter conversions. For instance, *#-paid* reported that 42% of consumers feel negatively about undisclosed partnerships.

Looking ahead to 2023 and beyond, UGC continues to gain momentum. Key trends include:


- **Increased Investment in Video Content:** 79% of marketers are planning to invest in video content, indicating a continued shift towards visual UGC.
- **Social Media Influence on Purchases:** 69% of consumers are influenced by social media when making purchases, highlighting the commercial potential of UGC.
- **Rise of Curation as a Service:** With the overwhelming amount of content available, businesses that can effectively curate quality content will have a competitive advantage.
- **Need for Transparency:** As consumers become more savvy, businesses will need to manage transparency effectively to maintain trust and prevent conversion deterrence.

Businesses that can navigate these trends will be at the forefront of the evolving digital marketplace.

## The Advent of AI

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer a futuristic concept; it's a present reality reshaping the e-commerce landscape. The last year has seen a spectacular acceleration in generative AI: 


- **Superb Creative Content**: Generate high-quality content across various formats, including text, code, and graphics.
- **Efficient Processing and Summarization**: Process and summarize large volumes of unstructured content rapidly and accurately.
- **Streamlined Workflow Execution**: Interact with interfaces to execute workflows faster and more efficiently.

The power of generative AI was suddenly demonstrated to the general audience with the release of *ChatGPT*; this kind of product has been in the making by only a few small teams across the world — the few researchers of these teams are now the limiting factor to create new economic actors in the field.

Generative AI is about to boost commerce in all parts of the journey and create a new industry ($10B market size as of 2022, projected to be $110B by 2030, with an estimated growth rate of 35% per year), by seamlessly enhancing the human mind with machine capabilities. It is a transformative technology for the world economy that will change the nature of work to bring
positive societal changes.

Here are five examples on how AI will transform collaborative commerce:

| **Value**                                                | **Before**                                                                                                                                                                                                           | **After**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. **Multimedia Shopping**                               | Products are simply text, listed in the title and description. Customers can only search using keywords.                                                                                                             | Products are vivid and multi-dimensional. AI models can use images, videos and text to provide expert advice about them in relation to the customer. The models uses individual and universal data to understand not only products, but cultural trends and emerging behaviors.                                                           |
| 2. **Intelligent Matching and Collaboration:**           | Partners and suppliers are often matched based on basic criteria such as employee count and industry, which may not always result in the most productive collaborations.                                             | Analyze a wide range of data to rapidly align suppliers and partners based on shared demographics, content preferences, and other relevant factors. This streamlines collaborations and increases the likelihood of successful outcomes.                                                                                                  |
| 3. **Real-Time and Enhance Data Collaboration Spaces:**  | Data sharing between partners and suppliers is often limited and unstructured, leading to missed opportunities for insights and collaboration.                                                                       | Secure data collaboration spaces enable efficient data exchange between partners and suppliers. These spaces can unlock valuable insights from various parties, fostering more effective collaborations.                                                                                                                                  |
| 4. **Enhanced User Experience and Sales Opportunities:** | User-generated content (UGC) is often underutilized, and opportunities for up-selling across the partner ecosystem may be missed.                                                                                    | Manage and analyze UGC to enhance shopping experiences and boost conversions. It can also identify up-selling opportunities across the partner ecosystem, allowing for global horizontal up-selling to expand reach and increase sales.                                                                                                   |
| 5. **Transparency and Personalization:**                 | The relationship between partners and suppliers is often a black box to the customer. These partnerships are often masked with “*#-ads*" or “*sponsored content*”, making the nature of these relationships unclear. | Provide personalized transparency to customers about the relationship between partners and suppliers, enhancing trust and loyalty. This could include sharing information about how partners and suppliers work together to deliver value, or personalizing communications based on the customer's previous interactions and preferences. |

Major players like *Amazon* and *Walmart* are already leveraging these AI capabilities. Amazon's recommendation system, powered by AI, personalizes the shopping experience for each customer, enhancing engagement and driving sales. However, there’s nothing to help small to mid-market businesses and individuals leverage this technology. The advent of AI in commerce is not just about technology; it's about enhancing human capabilities and changing how we collaboratively work.

## Why Hasn't this Been Solved Yet?

We're attempting to tap into the $17 billion affiliate marketing industry with tools that were designed when the Internet was still a novelty. Our infrastructure for collaborative commerce hasn't kept up.

We have to completely rethink how collaborative commerce should be approached. A recent article by Hacker Noon, a respected community publisher, highlights the current state of e-commerce:


> "Shoppers still work their way through large catalogs of products, fiddling with filters, clicking through categories, guessing the right keywords, and swiping through product detail pages.
> 
> Shoppers still have to do all of the work to find the perfect product that will make their day (or outfit). A time traveler from the 1990s would find most e-commerce sites look and operate today just like some of the first online shopping experiences during the early ‘dot com’ days.
> 
> While shoppers appreciate access to a bigger selection of products, cheaper prices, and delivery convenience, the shopping experience still feels pretty subpar. It’s 2023; where are our jetpacks?”

It feels as if we're working with separate pieces of a puzzle that refuse to fit together. Each tool, each platform, has its own unique rules and functions, making the exchange of data and resources a challenge. 

And it's not just about miscommunication—it's about wasted opportunities. Imagine setting aside funds for a marketing campaign, only to see it dissipate without knowing if it brought any meaningful returns.

But it's time for change. It's time to build an infrastructure that's fit for today—transparent, adaptable, ready to maximize partnerships and grasp tomorrow's opportunities.

## How Big Can it Get?

The opportunity is massive. No one has built a simple and consumer-friendly way to access products and services on the internet to sell in their own way. But, the strategic real estate that P307 occupies in a business the nature of the problem we solve opens up a number of large adjacent opportunities for us over time.


- **Short-Form Video Commerce (*****Qortor*****):** Enable creators to monetize content by embedding e-commerce into quick videos, thus rewarding consumers for their purchases.
- **Holistic Fitness Marketplace:** An all-in-one fitness app that tracks workouts, offers personalized gear and supplement recommendations, and enables in-app purchases.
- **Event Planning and Gifting:** Streamline event management and gifting with a platform that offers event pages, guest list management, and merchant-wide gift registries.
- **Travel-Enhanced Commerce:** An immersive travel platform offering curated products relevant to your destination, streamlining vacation planning and purchases.
- **Non-Profit Revenue Share:** Link fundraising and commerce by letting nonprofits partner with communities and businesses for product promotion, sharing a portion of proceeds with the nonprofit.
# Competition

As mentioned previously, P307 is a hybrid of three different software categories:


- Hybrid 01
- Hybrid 01
- Hybrid 03


## Competitor Breakdown

P307 replaces multiple categories of tools typically used by small to mid-market suppliers and partners to manage non-payroll spend, with a single comprehensive platform: 

Request and Approval Workflows: These happen via email, Slack, JIRA, Google Forms or through dedicated tools like Procurify 

Corporate Cards: Amex, banks (and newer offerings like Brex) are popular options 

Expense reimbursement: Expensify is a popular option Accounts Payable / 

Bill payments: Bill.com is the leading player in the mid-market.

The ecosystem of tools to solve non-payroll spend management evolved this way primarily because they are either front ends to specific payment rails used by businesses to pay their vendors (corporate cards for Visa / Mastercard / Amex, and Bill.com for ACH / check), or a specific business process (expense reimbursement)
